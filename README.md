# Boolbnb
This is a site inspired by World Leading Travel Site Airbnb, the goal for this project is purely scholastic and personal exercise to perfect the use of some technologies.
The site allows the user to search for apartments for rent throughout the Italian territory, thanks to a simple search by position or through an advanced search in which it is possible to better profile the search by specifying the number of beds, rooms or bathrooms , the distance from the center or according to the services offered.
The guest has the possibility to see all the information of the apartment, an interactive map to see the position, a gallery that allows you to have a complete view of the house and it's given the opportunity to write to the host to get more information about the rent.
The unregistered user therefore has the possibility to register on the portal, in order to access his private area in which he can add his apartments.
Each house has a messaging section with all the messages received, can be sponsored by paying for one of the three available advertising plans (Basic, Standard and Premium), but also hidden to make it not visible to guests.
